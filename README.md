# Federated_ML_in_Wearables_Data
The aim of this project is to compare the performance of federated learning vs conventional machine learning approach by measuring loss function indicated by mean absolute error (MAE) in prediction of absolute intensity of exercise using age and heart rate of users collected from wearable devices.

After implementation of FL in the HR-INT dataset, loss function was computed as a result. Loss function which was measured using the mean absolute error formula was found to be 0.03 and 0.03 for Bob and Alice virtual workers respectively. The mean absolute error of conventional machine learning approach was found to be 0.07.

## Value of this project
Based on review of literature, there are very few studies that have practically implemented federated learning in the wearables industry and highlighted its importance in data security due to the novelty of this field. Existing studies are either theoretical and abstract or survey based. This project addresses this research gap by practically demonstrating federated learning in data derived from wearables along with comparing it against conventional machine learning approach. 

## Intended audience
This project is intended for data scientists, engineers working in the wearables industry and policy makers working in the cybersecurity domain to help them understand the considerations of implementing FL to enhance privacy.

## Implications of this project
Future works can aim to implement FL with machine learning models in unbalanced data captured from real time wearables users and evaluate its performance against a conventional ML approach. In the sport industry, further studies can explore the performance of federated learning in sport and exercise performance prediction and storage & maintenance of athlete records in management systems due to the sensitive 
nature of data involved in these domains.
